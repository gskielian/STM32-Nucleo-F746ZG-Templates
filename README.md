# STM32-Nucleo-F746ZG QuickStart Templates

This is a _very_ powerful board with a particularly impressive max clock speed of 108MHz -- with external oscillator.

# how to install

File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace, and select this repo.


# Checkpoints kept as different branches
Will be keeping checkpoints available as different branches, which makes learning implementation as easy as:

`git diff vanilla_branch...blink_leds`

where vanilla branch will be the most basic branch.

# Checkout different abilities via branches

Aim is to have everything from `blink_leds` to `btle_android_hello_world`,
checkout different branches to gain access to capabilities.

# Contributing

if you would like to contribute, first checkout some branch (try the vanilla branch if possible in order to keep it lean), rename branch to your capability, and pull request -- it's that simple : )
